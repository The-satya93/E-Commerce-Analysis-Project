# Objective:
The main goal is to analyze e-commerce data to understand profit, sales trends, and product performance.


# Key Steps in the Analysis
# Data Collection:
Gather data from github in csv file.

# Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.
Convert data types as necessary (e.g., dates to datetime format).

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Use statistical methods to summarize the data.
Identify patterns, trends, and outliers through visualizations.

# Data Visualization:
Create charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, pie charts) to represent findings visually.
Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are commonly used for this purpose.

# Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for data analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and documentation.

#   Project Step:

1. You need to calculate the monthly sales of the store and identify which month had the 
highest sales and which month had the lowest sales.
 2. You need to analyze sales based on product categories and determine which category has 
the lowest sales and which category has the highest sales.
 3. The sales analysis needs to be done based on sub-categories
 4. You need to analyze the monthly profit from sales and determine which month had the 
highest profit.
 5. Analyze the profit by category and sub-category.
 6. Analyze the sales and profit by customer segment
 7. Analyze the sales to profit rati
